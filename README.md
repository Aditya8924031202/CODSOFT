# CODSOFT Internship Projects  

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The internship required completing at least 3 projects, and I chose:  

1. **Chatbot**  
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**  
3. **Recommendation System**  

Each project helped me understand different concepts of AI and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects  

### 1. Chatbot ðŸ¤–  
I built a basic chatbot using Python that replies to user messages with simple if-else rules. It was my first step toward understanding how chat systems work and how conversations are handled by programs. Running it is easyâ€”you just start the file and chat with it in the terminal.

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI ðŸŽ®  
This project is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, which makes it smart enough to never lose. It taught me how game theory and decision-making can be applied in AI.

### 3. Recommendation System ðŸŽ¯  
I created a basic recommendation system that suggests items to users based on similarity. It gave me an idea of how platforms like Netflix or Amazon recommend movies or products. This project helped me explore data handling and simple machine learning concepts.

## ðŸ“– Learnings  
- Basics of **rule-based chatbots**  
- Understanding of **AI in games (Minimax algorithm)**  
- How **recommendation engines** work  

This internship gave me hands-on experience with practical AI applications ðŸš€.
